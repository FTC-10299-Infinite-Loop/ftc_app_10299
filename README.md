FTC Team 10299 Code:

This code should run without any trouble on the robot phone of a robot. If I have time I'll put descriptions of the config setups you need and so on, but if need be you can figure out through the code or by emailing me at kenyonprater3.14 @ gmail . com.

Basically everything here is a mess of "it worked for that one time we needed it to work". No effort has been made to clean it up as of yet, and you should assume everything is broken before using it.

If you want to install this, first download the FTC source, then copy all of this into that same directory. I did some messy stuff with the gitignore and I don't know if it'll work or not on its own or if I forgot to commit something required from the FTC files.

So basically, I am so sorry you have to look at this code. Let me know if you need help and I'll be happy to provide it.
